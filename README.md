### Setup

\$ yarn

- install packages

\$ yarn dev

- Starts the development server.

## Where to look

- pages/index.js: this is the "home page" for the app
- src/components: add/modify components here
  -- All components should have their own directory in src/components
  --- Inside each directory should be the component JS file, and an index.js file that exports the component
